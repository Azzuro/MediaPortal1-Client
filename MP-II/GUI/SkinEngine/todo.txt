=== add more layout managers: ===

grid(columns, rows) 
grid(columns, rows, xspacing, yspacing)
stack(yspacing)
flow(xspacing)


=== add an "auto" option to the width and height attributes of controls... ===

when set this will set the width/height automaticly to the width/height of the parent control,
or in case the parent control is a layout control (like a group) it will follow those rules.

why do we need this?:

at the time we have support for vector graphics this will give a great improvement to styles. they can be
made for any resolution then and would auto-scale to the containers size
