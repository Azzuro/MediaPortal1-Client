  /// This class helps to resolve complete file paths for the local system by specifying
  /// a path string with placeholders for special registered path parts, like the path
  /// where the application was started (APPLICATION_ROOT), for example.
  /// Its also possible to add/remove/replace path registrations manually.
  /// A path pattern to be resolved by the PathManager can contain any path labels to be replaced
  /// with the registered values. All labels in the form &lt;[LABLE]&gt; will be replaced
  /// by their corresponding registered path.
  /// Registered path patterns can also contain references to other path registrations.
  /// <example>A path pattern will look like this:
  /// <c>&lt;LOG&gt;/MediaPortal.log</c>, where <c>&lt;LOG&gt;</c> is a reference to the path registered
  /// for the label <i>LOG</i>. If the label <i>LOG</i> was registered with the path
  /// <i>C:\Temp</i> for example, the pattern would be resolved to <i>C:\Temp\MediaPortal.log</i>.</example>
