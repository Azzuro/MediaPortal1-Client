This is the beginings of the Input Service plugin.

Don't panic.  It's rough right now, but I have big plans.

The Input Service is in the MediaPortal plugins SVN.

It is included with and compatible with my IR Server Suite.  But the Service is not distributed with IR Server Suite.

So you can go to the plugin svn to download the source, or go to my ftp folder (\Members\and-81) to get a current working copy.
