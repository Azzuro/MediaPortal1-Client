<!-- Hello world workflow states -->
<Workflow DescriptorVersion="1.0">
  <States>
    <!-- This is the workflow state which corresponds to the hello world screen. Each workflow state corresponds to
         a certain UI state. The id is needed to be able to reference the state, for example in the action which
         navigates to this state, see in file hello-world-actions.xml.

         The name of the state is only needed for debug reasons and will not be shown to the user.

         The MainScreen will automatically be shown by the workflow manager when switching to the state.
         It is also possible to set the screen programmatically when using a workflow model.

         The DisplayLabel is the string which is shown in the Navigation bar for this state. -->
