  /// Different kinds of players have very different kinds of methods and properties.

  /// Note that each player needs also to implement the <see cref="CurrentTime"/> and <see cref="Duration"/>
  /// properties, even picture players (and other players without a "native" play time). Those players should
  /// implement these properties as if their media content would have a play duration (i.e. they should return a
  /// small amount of time to present their content, maybe 3 seconds). The reason is, when used in a playlist,
  /// this media contents will also be shown for their desired <see cref="Duration"/>, for example pictures will
