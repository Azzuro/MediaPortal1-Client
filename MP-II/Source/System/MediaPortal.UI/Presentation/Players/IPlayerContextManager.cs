  /// The functionality of this component is comprehensive, it deals with the collectivity of all players, while the
  /// <see cref="IPlayerManager"/>'s functionality is mostly focused to single technical player slots.
  /// This service manages and solves player conflicts (like two audio players at the same time) automatically by
  /// simply closing an old player when a new conflicting player is opened. Non-conflicting players can be played
  /// concurrently.
  /// The technical target player slot (primary/secondary) of a given <see cref="IPlayerContext"/>
  /// is managed almost transparently for the client. There is a rare number of cases where the client needs to cope
  /// with the set-up of primary and secondary players, for example when two video players are running, one of them as
  /// PIP player. In that situation, it can be necessary to explicitly exchange the player slots.
