To create the selfextracting package you need WinRAR 3.71.

Files to include:

   MediaPortal.DeployTool.exe
   Interop.NetFwTypeLib.dll
   de-de\MediaPortal.DeployTool.resources.dll


If others localization files are added, you must include them

Once the RAR is created, look at WinRAR_*.jpg to complete the job
