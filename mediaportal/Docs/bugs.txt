myTV 
I enter my TV and watch channel 1. 
I hit the "record now" button. 
I stop recording, say, after 10 minutes. 
I am zapping to channel 3. 
I leave my TV. 
I enter my TV expecting to see channel 3, but i see the recorded program from channel 1. 
EPG shows the info of channel 3. 

Same with programmed recording: 
I enter my TV Guide and select a program for record. 
I leave my TV and wait until recording is done. 
I enter my TV and i see the recorded show. Not the normal TV program.
