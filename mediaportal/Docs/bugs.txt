Bugs left:
  30-06-2004 my programs: returns to home when stopping a game
  29-06-2004 home       : scroll speed 9 / 10 are the same
  27-06-2004 my TV      : some cards have 2 CVBS inputs
  
  27-06-2004 general    : The thumbnails for movies and artists are not always shown. 
                          this happens if the name of the artist in the tag 
                          or the name of the moviefile is not the same as the information 
                          that was retrieved from the internet. For example I had the artist Bjork, 
                          I retrieved the artist information and there the name was Bjo"rk 
                          Now the thumb gets saved with that name instead of Bjork and since Bjork is 
                          the name in the database the thumbs don't show up.
  27-06-2004 general    : The same happens for movies if the filename does not match the name that was 
                          retrieved from the internet.

                          artists first, now only 1 still shows as various artists. 
  02-05-2004 my music   : When having 2 albums with the same name it is shown as 1 with artist = various artists. However, there r albums with the same name from different artists. (big change needed in database engine)
