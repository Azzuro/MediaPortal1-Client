  09-08-2004 music      : "Now playing song" not updated after skipping to next song (previous song stays red).
  02-08-2004 my tv      : dual tuner setup: when recording with card#1 you cannot switch tv channels anymore
                          since card#1 is also used for tv viewing instead of card #2

                          "actual real live tv" (and it can't forward any more, becuse it has got to the end 
                          of the buffer) it should automaticly go to "normal playup" (1X). 
  02-08-2004 my tv      : black screen when recording has ended
  02-08-2004 my tv      : If you press "PLAY" during back- forwarding you want it to play
  02-08-2004 my tv      : When you go to the "tv guide" it seems like it ment that the tv will pause untill 
                          you return from the "guide". For me it's not working, becuse it's forwarding 
                          (>> very fast). and when it has reached the end of the "live" buffer the 
                          pictures freezes and is not comming back

                          Reacts after pressing it a couple of times. Won´t happen with timeshifting on.
