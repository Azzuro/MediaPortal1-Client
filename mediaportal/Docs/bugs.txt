Bugs i cannot fix (yet):
    - rescale causes borders to appear on topbar buttons (new topbar)
        reason : this is produced by DirectX scaling. Gotta know more about DirectX to find out how 2 fix this
    - my pictures: Quality of pics is degraded since DX9 is used. 
        reason : this is produced by DirectX scaling. Gotta know more about DirectX to find out how 2 fix this
    - window uses wrong resolution, 720x569 instead of 720x576
        reason : cannot reproduce the bug

Need to check/confirm if these bugs really exist:
    - the Playlists no longer seem to work in the Music Player. I create them inside MP, and they work as I'm building them, but if I save them and try to load them later, they won't play at all. 
    - When first going to the TV module--it takes a long time for the channel to display, and when it does, it has no sound until I change the channel. 
    - When it does record, there is no sound in the recording. I've tried different compressors, etc, as well as setting my audio capture device to None. 
    - there is indeed a bug that causes the folder.jpg not to be used on the music overlay. 
    - when out of focus music won't continue.
    - at the end of a song, mp rewrites id3 v1 in a mp3 file. this happens when wmp is set as audio player... 

Confirmed Bugs:
    - action 79 in keymap does not work
    - MPReader : XCDs dont work anymore
    - dvd        : osd pause doesnt work
    - capture    : CVBS/SVHS in  doesnt work
    - capture    : tuner not found
    - reorganise database does not update tags. Meaning an album it finds wich had various artists first, now only 1 still shows as various artists. 
    - When having 2 albums with the same name it is shown as 1 with artist = various artists. However, there r albums with the same name from different artists. (big change needed in database engine) 
    - Some TV-cards do not change channel till after exiting and entering MyTv again. 
    - F3 and get the album immediately, the thumb is not shown. Will be shown when some other song gets a list on F3 
    - some WM9 visz. like g-force just show a black screen
