myTV 
I enter my TV and watch channel 1. 
I hit the "record now" button. 
I stop recording, say, after 10 minutes. 
I am zapping to channel 3. 
I leave my TV. 
I enter my TV expecting to see channel 3, but i see the recorded program from channel 1. 
EPG shows the info of channel 3. 

Same with programmed recording: 
I enter my TV Guide and select a program for record. 
I leave my TV and wait until recording is done. 
I enter my TV and i see the recorded show. Not the normal TV program.

my DVD 
I start DVD playback. 
I stop DVD playback. 
Overlay picture resides on screen, i see the last picture before hitting the stop button. 
I can use MP after that (when i browse "blindly" ). But something seems to hang in the system, because the CPU usage is about 100%. Also the macrovision signal of the Cyberlink codec is still activ. Only a restart of the computer solves the problem. This happens also with ripped DVDs on Harddisk (.IFO). 
I am using Cyberlink codecs (Video, Audio, Navigator). But i also tested my other codecs with the same result. 
I am using normal Overlay mode. DVD playback was ok until Build 29062004. With Build 29062004 the problem occured for the first time on my machine.
