FFDSHOW
    FFDSHOW is a DirectShow decoding filter for decompressing DivX, XviD, WMV and MPEG-1 movies. 
    It uses libavcodec from ffmpeg project for video decompression, postprocessing code 
    from mplayer to enhance visual quality of low bitrate movies, and is based on original 
    DirectShow filter from XviD, which is GPL'ed educational implementation of MPEG4 encoder. 
    this is probably one of the best codec suites out there! so install it

XVID:
    XviD is an ISO MPEG-4 compliant video codec. It's no product, it's an open source 
    project which is developed and maintained by lots of people from all over the world.

Opensource MPEG-1&2 codec
    Out of the box windows doesnt play mpeg 2 files. You will have to install an mpeg2 codec
    Most people use an mpeg2 codec which comes with programs like WinDVD , PowerDVD or InterVideo
    However those codecs only seem to work on overlay devices, not on VMR9. 
    If you want a free opensource mpeg2 codec which really works in all cases then look here:
    GPL MPEG 1&2 codec : http://sourceforge.net/projects/gplmpgdec/


RadLight Filter Manager:
    This little tool allows you to change merit of DirectShow filters (codecs,parsers,...).
    Each filter is registered with a merit value. When the filter graph manager builds a graph, 
    it enumerates all the filters registered with the correct media type. Then it tries them in 
    order of merit, from highest to lowest. (It uses additional criteria to choose between filters with equal merit.) 
    Using this tool YOU can specify which filters/codecs should b used for playback and which wont
