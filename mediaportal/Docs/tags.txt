In the .xml files of the skin you can use the list of tags (see below) to show info about the current
playing file. These special tags currently work for the following controls:
    - button
    - label 
    - fadelabel 
    - textscrollup
    - progress
    - image
    - tvprogress 
These special tags are placed in the <label></label> field of the controls and contain the
tagname and any other text you want.

example of an label control :
    <control>
        <description>example label control showwing the current play time </description>
