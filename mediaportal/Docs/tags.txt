In the .xml files of the skin you can use the list of tags (see below) to show info about the current
playing file. These special tags currently work for the button, label & fadelabel control.
These special tags are placed in the <label></label> field of the controls and contain the
tagname and any other text you want.

example of an label control :
    <control>
        <description>example label control showwing the current play time </description> 
        <type>label</type> 
        <id>2</id> 
        <posX>575</posX> 
        <posY>45</posY> 
        <label>playtime:#currentplaytime</label> 
        <align>left</align> 
        <font>font13</font> 
        <textcolor>FFB2D4F5</textcolor> 
    </control> 

example of an fadelabel: 
(note that \r means a new line in the fadelabel control)
    <control>
        <description>example fadelabel control showing & scrolling title, genre, year & director tag</description> 
        <type>fadelabel</type>
