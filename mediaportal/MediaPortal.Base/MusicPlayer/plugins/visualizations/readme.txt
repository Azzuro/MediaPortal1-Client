This folder contains Visualisation Plugins used within Mediaportal.

Attention:

- Sonique Visualisations can be placed anywhere in this folder or in sub folders. We would recommend using the Sonique folder for that

- Winamp Visualisations MUST be placed in the Plugins subfolder.
  No other sub folders should be created, except when a plugin needs it.
  
  Let's use Milkdrop as an example:
  
  MusicPlayer
     !
	 !- Plugins
	      !
		  !- Visualizations
		          !
				  !- Plugins
						!
						!- Milkdrop2    	<--- This is the folder, which you copied over from your Winamp Installation's Plugins folder
						!- vis_milk2.dll	<--- This is the milkdrop2 executable, which you copied over from your Winamp installation's Plugins folder
